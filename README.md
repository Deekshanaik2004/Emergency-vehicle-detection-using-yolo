Emergency Vehicle Detection and Intelligent Traffic Management System
DSATM'25 Hackathon Project - TEAM S-28 - Copypaste Cult
üß† Overview
This project showcases a real-time, AI-powered emergency vehicle detection and intelligent traffic management system, designed to prioritize life-saving responses. Leveraging deep learning with YOLOv8, computer vision using OpenCV, and interactive simulation built with Pygame, the system autonomously detects emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) and dynamically adjusts traffic signals to ensure their swift and safe passage through intersections.

üöÄ Key Features
Real-time Emergency Vehicle Detection
Utilizes YOLOv8 to detect emergency vehicles from live webcam feeds, images, or video files.

Intelligent Traffic Signal Control
Automatically adapts traffic light states to prioritize emergency vehicle movement.

Interactive Traffic Simulation
Built using Pygame, simulates traffic scenarios with emergency vehicles and signal control in real time.

Multi-class Vehicle Classification

Emergency Vehicles: Ambulance, Fire Truck, Police Car

Non-emergency Vehicles: Cars, Bikes, Trucks, etc.
